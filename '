    <p>I am Tejomay &mdash; a data scientist, researcher, and a graduate student at NYU.</p>

    <p>On this page of mine, you will find projects, methods, tools, inquiries, perspectives, and ideas; I hope you take a moment to appreciate their diversity, because if you do, you may just catch a glimpse of their convergence.</p>

    <p>"You should not analyze yourself." &ndash; Hannah Arendt</p>

    <p>What is data science? It blossoms in front of our very eyes, yet we struggle to define it.</p>

    <p>Whether it be cutting-edge network science methods that illuminate politics, large-scale randomized-controlled-trials revolutionizing governance, or statistical learning methods accelerating the human sciences, my last ten years of work has not been simply taken place within this blossoming; <i>rather it is the blossoming itself</i>.</p>

    <p>Therefore, without knowing it or trying, I have cultivated an expertise in the field of our age. In that spirit, I offer some threads that bind my work together, and perhaps even offer a preliminary understanding into what data science even is &mdash; </p>
