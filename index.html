    <p>Welcome, <img src = "tej.jpg" width = "128" height = "128" style = "float:right" alt = "Tejomay"></p>

    <p>I'm Tejomay &mdash; I'm a data scientist, researcher, and a graduate student at NYU.</p>

    <p>The offerings of my site &mdash; projects, methods, inquiries, tools, perspectives, thoughts, ideas &mdash; are multiple; in pondering this you may catch a glimpse of their convergence.</p>

    <p>"You should not analyze yourself." &ndash; Hannah Arendt</p>

    <p>What is data science? It blossoms in front of us, yet we are perplexed in .</p>

    <p>Whether it be cutting-edge network science methods that illuminate politics, large-scale randomized-controlled-trials revolutionizing governance, or statistical learning methods accelerating the human sciences, my last ten years of work has not been simply taken place within this blossoming; <i>rather it is the blossoming itself</i>.</p>

    <p>Therefore, without knowing it or trying, I have cultivated an expertise in the field of our age. In that spirit, I offer some threads that bind my work together, and perhaps even offer a preliminary understanding into what data science even is &mdash; </p>
