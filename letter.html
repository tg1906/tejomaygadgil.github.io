        <p>Well &mdash; good question &mdash; I think this website is an attempt to house, situate (web-<i>site</i>), or unify the many themes and interests that run through my work. Like something you can't explain but you know fits together, and if you are convinced that if you put the pieces together in the right way, that perhaps you can convey it to another person, not with words but <i>experience</i> (we can, for now, bracket the difference between the two). Like a great movie, or something &mdash; like, I think, <i>design itself</i>.</p>

<p>Provisionally, the aim is to showcase my research &mdash; like for instance something I'm working on is this politics research looking at the network dynamics of news sharing on Twitter (with emphasis on fake or disinformative news). So there's a pipeline that finds people who shared a particular URL on Twitter, and then gets (1) their timeline and (2) friend/follower network &mdash; so, schematically, f(URL) = {timeline_i, network_i for all user_i who shared that URL}. Then you can do fun stuff like look at the topology of the network, the content of the timelines, and so on.  I would like to, for instance &mdash; and since literally the entire pipeline is built, all that "really remains" (i.e. 80% of the work lol) is to make a nice interface so someone could maybe enter in a keyword (too ambitious, I think I'll just have a dropdown of pre-computed data) and then get a cool data-viz-y network graph thing that they can explore &mdash; pretty much like a dashboard that will tell you about the way the story was shared (diffused through the network) and the structure of the resulting user graph, maybe some light content analysis of the timelines (hashtags shared, etc.). Kinda neat, and for sure will give me useful web and design skills, and if I put two or three of these "mini-projects" up will provide a nice portfolio for prospective employers &mdash; but we know that's not the aim here.</p>

<p>Perhaps now we can bring in that difference I bracketed earlier &mdash; I think there is something very crucial about <i>language and experience</i>, the ways in which the two, if they are not the same, profoundly inform one another. And I think <i>design</i>, somehow, sits squarely in the middle of, under, or <i>is the communion that the two share</i>.<p>

<p>And I think most people typically neglect one for the other.</p>

<p>And I think we are too hasty to in claiming to know what data science is &mdash; I think we prevent ourselves from thinking about what it could, should, or <i>might already be</i>.</p>

<p>To bring in another difference &mdash;</p>

<p>I think, "ontically," this website offers a break from doldrum &mdash; there's far more interesting things we can do over and above rote analyses that, frankly, could be automated. I'd like a place to practice writing of various kinds, thoughts, ponderings like this, and also, explanations of confusing topics in statistics or data science, etc. And maybe this is idealistic (guilty as charged), but I think that, given a space, some of the thoughts I have may find the proper ground for articulation &mdash; a sort of diaristic aspect, I suppose.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the "ontological" aspect &mdash; I think this website, or its prospect, intrigues me not just as a space to work out, craft, explore &mdash; either in language or in the language of coding &mdash; some of these themes of tool-building and expression (which somehow involves tools) I just laid out, but, fascinatingly, a website intruiges me in that it <i>is this very space that allows me to do any of this</i>! Not to make too grotesque of an analogy here, but insofar as you ask me what my work is about, part of it is absolutely an attempt to work out something analogous to like, if Heidegger studies the question of the meaning of Being within Being (as a being), then maybe the website is itself a portal (haha) for a similarly veined ontological study. Sort of like the pun of saying "I study data science" &mdash; that is, I study things with it, and with things I study it.</p>

<p>That said, I'm not saying any of this is possible &mdash; but it is is the intention.</p>
